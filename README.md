## Kiki Dawson

I enjoy the creativity involved in problem solving. I gain the same type of satisfaction from both mathematical and artistic subjects; for me coding is an amalgamation of the two. I want to be continuously developing and evolving my coding skills and emotional intelligence. There is always something to learn and research in tech and I’d like to be part of that.

## Experience

#### Heritage Independent Living
- Introductory live-in care agency for the elderly
- ***Consultant*** (November 2019 to October 2020)
- ***Administrator and Junior Consultant*** (January 2019 to November 2019)

Our CRM made it difficult to see when clients had gaps in their care plans, meaning a client could be left without a carer. I didn't think that was a sensible or necessary risk. I started recording all my clients planned carers in excel so gaps couldn't be missed. This decreased the number of emergencies I had (carer needed within 2 weeks) so my director asked me to implement this for everyone.

Clients needs could change very suddenly so it was key that, as consultants, we were in constant contact with each other. When we had to start working from home, the team began really struggling without our usual flow of information. My colleagues weren't confident with anything technical so I realised it was up to me to sort. I set up instant messaging, google docs (to replace our office whiteboard), conference calls, and zoom meetings. This worked so well the team aren't planning on going back into the office ever.

We found out that lots of errors were being made on our clients invoices so, in April 2019, we brought invoicing and credit control in-house and I was given sole responsibility. I streamlined the process to decrease the chances of human error, which led to complaints decreasing by a significant amount. Used; SageOne, Stipe, GoCardless

#### Charles Tyrwhitt
- Menswear shop, Jermyn Street
- ***Part-time Sales Assistant*** (November 2017 to October 2018)

I was working part-time while studying bespoke tailoring at college. I was employee of the month in August 2018, which I was awarded for positive attitude and boosting my colleagues morale.

I was proud of the service I was able to provide to customers and had many returning clients as a result. I researched the products we sold and used facts about the fabric and cut, and the history of each piece to help customers find the perfect suit. I was able to get restocked and alterations completed quickly due to the good relationship I had with my colleagues.

#### Casino Gold
- Small Adult Gaming Centre
- ***Manager*** (May 2017 to November 2017)
- ***Floor Supervisor*** (September 2016 - May 2017)

The customer counter showed that footfall had increased during my time as manager. I had put some promotional incentives in place but the regular customers said they had started making more visits because they enjoyed the environment when I was around. This made me realise that my success was at the detriment of the customers and I couldn't stay much longer after that.

When I arrived, all the machine checks were done by hand and recorded on paper. Unsurprisingly, this led to lots of errors and our result estimate was usually out by about £30 a week. I started recording everything in a spreadsheet and our estimates were only out by pennies.

Unfortunately, dealing with angry and upset customers was a daily part of this job. I honed a lot of my soft skills including giving bad news. I was always firm but stayed kind.

#### Chinese Educators
- ***Au Pair*** (May 2016 - August 2016)

I was a live-in English and maths tutor for an 8 year old girl in Beijing. I enjoyed learning Mandarin and having cooking lessons.

#### Travelling & Hospitality
- (February 2015 - May 2016)

In Australia, I bought a van and converted it into a campervan. I stopped in various places and worked on farms, in restaurants, in bars, and as a receptionist of a hostel among other things. I added 37000kms to the clock and a year later sold it for $1300 more than I bought it for. Then flew to SE Asia and spent a few months travelling and diving before heading to China to be an au pair.

## Skills

#### Emotional Intelligence

I find emotions very interesting, both my own and others. During Makers, I realised how important reflecting is. I find that reflection helps remove the emotion from difficult situations so the facts can be focused on. This is particularly helpful when giving and receiving feedback, especially when emotionally invested in projects.

I completed a 10 week empathy training course when I joined The Samaritans in October 2019. I had been volunteering as a listener since then but when COVID hit, I was unable to continue. This is something I will be starting again once I'm fully settled in Bristol. 

#### Growth Mindset

I like not being the most knowledgeable one in the room because it means I'm able to learn and grow. I'm passionate about stretching myself. One of the reasons for getting into software engineering is because there will always be something to develop and explore. I like the idea that in 5 years I could be working on something that doesn't exist today.

#### Initiative

I like finding the most efficient way to complete a task. I hadn't been hired to streamline processes but I saw inefficiencies that could easily be fixed. I came up with suggestions to improve them and, once approved, I put them into place. This increased accuracy of estimations at Casino Gold and decreased the number of complaints about invoicing errors at Heritage.
