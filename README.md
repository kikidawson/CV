## Kiki Dawson

I’ve always enjoyed the creativity involved in problem solving, which is why I gain the same type of satisfaction from both mathematical and artistic subjects. For me coding is an amalgamation of the two.

Tech is a developing sector and forever evolving. This means there will always be something to learn so there is no chance of becoming stagnant.
