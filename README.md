## Kiki Dawson

I enjoy the creativity involved in problem solving. I gain the same type of satisfaction from both mathematical and artistic subjects; for me coding is an amalgamation of the two. I want to be continuously developing and evolving my coding skills and emotional intelligence. There is always something to learn and research in tech and I like being part of that.

## Skills

#### Emotional Intelligence

I find emotions very interesting, both my own and others. During my career in software engineering, I have realised how important reflecting is. I find that reflection helps remove the emotion from difficult situations so the facts can be focused on. This is particularly helpful when giving and receiving feedback, especially when emotionally invested in projects.

#### Growth Mindset

I like not being the most knowledgeable one in the room because it means I'm able to learn and grow. I'm passionate about stretching myself. One of the reasons for getting into software engineering is because there will always be something to develop and explore. I like the idea that in 5 years I could be working on something that doesn't exist today.

##### Personal development:
Kata Club - I set up and ran a fortnightly lunch club where we would attack some kata's from codewars then share our different solutions. The goal was to get engineers to meet and give an opportunity to have fun with code.

#### Heritage Independent Living
- Introductory live-in care agency for the elderly
- ***Consultant*** (November 2019 to October 2020)
- ***Administrator and Junior Consultant*** (January 2019 to November 2019)

Our CRM made it difficult to see when clients had gaps in their care plans, meaning a client could be left without a carer. I didn't think that was a sensible or necessary risk. I started recording all my clients planned carers in excel so gaps couldn't be missed. This decreased the number of emergencies I had (carer needed within 2 weeks) so my director asked me to implement this for everyone.

Clients needs could change very suddenly so it was key that, as consultants, we were in constant contact with each other. When we had to start working from home, the team began really struggling without our usual flow of information. My colleagues weren't confident with anything technical so I realised it was up to me to sort. I set up instant messaging, google docs (to replace our office whiteboard), conference calls, and zoom meetings. This worked so well the team aren't planning on going back into the office ever.

We found out that lots of errors were being made on our clients invoices so, in April 2019, we brought invoicing and credit control in-house and I was given sole responsibility. I streamlined the process to decrease the chances of human error, which led to complaints decreasing by a significant amount. Used; SageOne, Stipe, GoCardless

#### Charles Tyrwhitt
- Menswear shop, Jermyn Street
- ***Part-time Sales Assistant*** (November 2017 to October 2018)

I was working part-time while studying bespoke tailoring at college. I was employee of the month in August 2018, which I was awarded for positive attitude and boosting my colleagues morale.

I was proud of the service I was able to provide to customers and had many returning clients as a result. I researched the products we sold and used facts about the fabric and cut, and the history of each piece to help customers find the perfect suit. I was able to get restocked and alterations completed quickly due to the good relationship I had with my colleagues.

#### Casino Gold
- Small Adult Gaming Centre
- ***Manager*** (May 2017 to November 2017)
- ***Floor Supervisor*** (September 2016 - January 2017)

The customer counter showed that footfall had increased during my time as manager. I implemented some promotional incentives and increased customer engagement, which positively affected loyalty. Customers frequently mentioned that they thought I had improved the atmosphere on the shopfloor.

When I arrived, all the machine checks were done by hand and recorded on paper. Unsurprisingly, this led to lots of errors and our result estimate was usually out by about Â£30 a week. I started recording everything in a spreadsheet and our estimates were only out by pennies.

I am resilient and often used my empathy, patience and compassion when dealing with confrontation and conflict which was commonplace.

#### Chinese Educators
- ***Au Pair*** (May 2016 - August 2016)

I was a live-in English and maths tutor for an 8 year old girl in Beijing. I enjoyed learning Mandarin and having cooking lessons.

I had to improve my non-verbal communication as the family I lived with had little English and I had even less Chinese. I quickly established a strong bond with the family. They ended up paying me double and offering me a visa extension.

#### Travelling
- ***Various Hospitality Jobs*** (February 2015 - May 2016)

In Australia, I bought a van and converted it into a campervan. I stopped in various places and worked on farms, in restaurants, in bars, and as a receptionist of a hostel among other things. I added 37000kms to the clock and a year later sold it for $1300 more than I bought it for. Then flew to SE Asia and spent a few months travelling and diving before heading to China to be an au pair.
