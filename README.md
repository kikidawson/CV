Iâ€™ve always enjoyed the creativity involved in problem solving, which is why I gain the same type of satisfaction from mathematical and artistic subjects. For me coding is an amalgamation of the two.

Tech is a developing sector and forever evolving. This means there will always be something to learn so there is no chance of becoming stagnant.

## Experience

**Heritage Independent Living** (January 2019 to October 2020)  
Consultant

- This was an admin heavy role due to the unsuitability of the company's CRM. I spent hours thinking of ways to make improve productivity by making the CRM better.

**Casino Gold** (September 2016 to November 2017)  
Manager

- After this job I decided that I will never again accept a job for a company or product I don't believe in. I didn't feel proud that I'd increased takings during my time manager as I knew this meant my customers were gambling more.
